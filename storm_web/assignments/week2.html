            This is a page I discovered about a week ago and really enjoyed. Not only because spotify and pitchfork are two of my top websites (which is indicated in my About Me page), but it uses a unique scrolling design that I thought was simple yet powerful. The typography utilizes the power of spacing and using text as interface. I read a couple of the other posts on the iA website and found the information very intruiguing - especially the article which discusses the relationship between the brand and the interface. The reading made me look at the importance of interface, and I think this website utilizes a unique interface that creates a positive and powerful user experience.

            I found this website while researching for my Korean culture class and was immediately appalled. Not only is the website ugly, but it is a complicated collection of blocky text and various media pushed together in a long string of information. What I found especially annoying was the lack of a directory or some sort of shortcut bar to jump to different sections in the text. The site requires you to sort through all of the complicated information to find what you want, which does not offer a positive user experience.
