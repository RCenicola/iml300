            This is a curated amazon store created by a group of designers that pick and choose trendy items from Amazon and put them all in one place. Not only are the items trendy, but the website is too. The layout is very simple and sleek, which allows for an efficient interface for user accessibility. I personally think the Amazon website is really cluttered and filled with flashy ads, so I go to Canopy to escape it. The grid on the site is split into three sections, with a item selection placed inside a square that is equipped with information about the product's price, purpose, social media hype, and a picture. The squares are really nice on the eyes and have a nice balance of information and white space. The categories page is also a super simple way to find just what you're looking for, designed in a similar fashion as the home page.

            This is a website my friend suggested I check out when we were dicussing web design. While I am a huge fan of the mission of the site, the layout is just atrocious. There does not seem to be any cohesion between the information - no grid structure to follow. The boxes of text are all different sizes, and the text does not even match up. As you scroll down, youll find boxes of information seemingly thrown in random places with no regard to their relationship with the information surrounding them. Some even overlap and cover each other. There is also a lot of information for one page - the eyes become overwhelemed by all of the text that have different fonts, leadings, font sizes, etc.
