    <h3>About Me</h3>
            
        <p>Hello! My name is Ryan Cenicola, a Sophomore from La Quinta, CA. I very much enjoy playing the guitar and drums, writing music, attending concerts, toppling the bourgeoisie, following baseball, exploring foreign places, and swimming. Some things that don't tickle my fancy include sitting for long periods of time, country music, procrastinating, and being cold.
        </p>
  
     <h3>Preferred Creative Media</h3>
        
        <p>I prefer watching videos/films over anything else. I was never much of a reader growing up, and was always able to retain much more information visually through videos. I also enjoy making my own films. </p>
    
    <h3>Preferred Applications</h3>
       
         <p>I am a huge fan of Spotify and think that it is a great disruptor in the music industry. I also dabble in Adobe Illustrator and Premiere. My Snapchat score is 127,235 so you could say I'm a fan of it. I also think Uber is super cool and am looking forward to when they team up with Tesla and their driverless cars take over the world. </p>
